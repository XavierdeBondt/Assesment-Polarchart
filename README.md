# Assesment Polarchart
Creation of the assesment polarchart using the `plot.ly` python library and `xlrd` to read from an excel file.

## Prerequisites
To use this project we expect the user to be using `python` with `xlrd` and `plotly` installed. For installation use     
```
$ pip install xlrd
$ pip install plotly
```

## Running the project
As a template we have included `template.xlsm` to show how the excel file should be built. To use this template with the program, rename it to `input.xlsm` and make sure it is in the same folder as `main.py`. The project can then be run by using
```
$ python main.py
```
